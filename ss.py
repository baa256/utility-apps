def screenshot():

    ''' Refresh window to get current window informations like :
Size and current location when user resize or move window around.
The above info is further used to determine how to take screenshots.
PIL's ImageGrab() takes arguments this way : (start-x, start-y, end-x, end-y)
So the user Region Of Interest could be gotten this way:
(window-x location, window-y location, window - x size, window -y size).
The above gives you user selected region.
NOTE : For some reasons ImageGrab doesn't include some areas with the above syntax.
So I added some pixels to tunne for accuracy. Take a look at "coord variable".
